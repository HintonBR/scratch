<FONT SIZE="4">Making Java Competitive for Numerical Computing </FONT></P>
<P>
The Java language (version 1.0) is not competitive for numerical 
computing. Most numerical development today is done with Fortran 90, 
MathWork's MatLab, Visual Numerics' PV-WAVE<SUP>&#174;</SUP> and 
similar languages. This document describes a set of changes to Java to 
make it competitive with these languages. This proposal addresses the 
key syntactical weaknesses of Java for numerical computing.</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4">Complex Numbers </FONT></P>
<P>
The first addition to Java is a <A
 HREF="VisualNumerics.math.Complex.html">class Complex </A>that 
implements double-precision complex arithmetic. Also the Java language 
would be extended to allow for the use of infix operators with Complex 
objects. In particular the unary operator - and the binary operators +, 
-, *, /, +=, -=, *=, /= will be extended to allow Complex operands. 
These binary operators will also be overloaded to allow for mixed 
double and Complex operands. The increment and modulus operators will 
not be overloaded for Complex. </P>
<P>
As an example, consider a function that finds a root of the quadratic 
equation. (This is just an example, this function is not proposed as 
part of JNL. This algorithm is not the best way to numerically compute 
the root.) With the proposed extensions, this could be written as 
follows. </P>
<P>
static Complex root(Complex a, Complex b, Complex c) {<BR>
 return (-b+Complex.sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a);<BR>
 } </P>
<P>
Without the extensions, the function could be written as follows. </P>
<P>
static Complex root(Complex a, Complex b, Complex c) {<BR>
 Complex b2 = Complex.multiply(b,b);<BR>
 Complex ac4 = Complex.multiply(4,Complex.multiply(a,c)); <BR>
 Complex discrim = Complex.sqrt(Complex.subtract(b2,ac4)); <BR>
 return 
Complex.divide(Complex.subtract(discrim,b)),Complex.multiply(2,a))); <BR>
 } </P>
<H3>
Issues for the class Complex: </H3>
<UL>
    <LI>
    Should both float complex and double complex be implemented? The 
    current JNL proposal calls for implementing only double complex. 
    <LI>
    Class Complex will contain static member functions analogous to those 
    now in class java.lang.Math. Exactly what functions should be included? 
    See <A HREF="VisualNumerics.math.Complex.html">class Complex</A>
     for the current proposal. 
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4">Array Operators </FONT></P>
<P>
This proposal calls for overloading the infix operators to work with 
arrays of built-in Java types: byte, short, int, char, float, double, 
boolean, and Complex. The operations will be applied elementwise. </P>
<P>
For example, the following code fragment </P>
<P>
double x[], y[], z[];<BR>
 /* omitted code to initialize x and y */<BR>
 z = x * y;<BR>
 </P>
<P>
is equivalent to </P>
<P>
double x[], y[], z[];<BR>
 /* omitted code to initialize x and y */<BR>
 if (x.length != y.length) throw IllegalArrayException;<BR>
 z = new double[x.length];<BR>
 for (int k = 0; k &lt; x.length; k++)<BR>
 z[k] = x[k] * y[k]; </P>
<P>
Infix operators are allowed for arrays only if they are allowed for the 
underlying simple types. </P>
<P>
Type promotion follows the same rules as for simple types. </P>
<H3>
Issues for Array Operators </H3>
<P>
For linear algebra only arrays of type double need to be overloaded. 
But for other arrays, such as image processing, operations on arrays of 
integral types are needed. </P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4">Array Sections </FONT></P>
<P>
This proposal also calls for adding an array section syntax to Java. If 
v is a one-dimensional array, then the array section v[3:9:2] stands 
for {v[3], v[5], v[7], v[9]}. The syntax is <I>first</I>:<I>last</I>:<I>increment</I>. 
All three parts are optional; they default to 0:length-1:1. Also 
allowed are the forms <I>first</I>:<I>last</I> and a single colon (:), 
which stands for the entire array. Array section operators can also be 
used with higher dimensional arrays, e.g. a[3:9:2][0:5], a[:][0:5]. </P>
<P>
Array sections can be lvalues, i.e. they can appear on the left side of 
the equal sign. In that case, changes to the section also change the 
underlying array values. In other cases, such as when a section is 
passed as an argument to a function, the section is an array containing 
a copy of the data. </P>
<P>
An array section operation can throw an 
ArraySectionOutOfBoundsException. </P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="5">JNL, a Java Numerical Library Proposal </FONT></P>
<P>
JNL, the Java Numerical Library proposal is a set of classes for the 
most important numerical functions missing in Java. These classes are 
independent of the Java Numerical Language proposal, except that both 
require class Complex. This part of the proposal does not require that 
the infix operators work with Complex numbers.</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4">Linear Algebra </FONT></P>
<P>
The linear algebra class manipulate rectangular or square arrays of 
type double or Complex. A rectangular matrix is a double[][] with all 
of its rows the same length. A square matrix is a rectangular matrix 
with the number of columns equal to the number of rows. </P>
<P>
The <A HREF="VisualNumerics.math.DoubleVector.html">class DoubleVector</A>
 contains static methods for manipulating vectors. It does not define 
a vector object; it is not possible to create an instance of 
DoubleVector. There are methods for vector norms, maximum and minimum 
elements, and dot product. </P>
<P>
The <A HREF="VisualNumerics.math.DoubleMatrix.html">class DoubleMatrix</A>
 contains static methods for manipulating matrices. It does not define 
a matrix object; it is not possible to create an instance of 
DoubleMatrix. There are methods for matrix multiplication, inversion 
and solving linear systems. </P>
<P>
The classes <A HREF="VisualNumerics.math.DoubleCholesky.html">DoubleCholesky</A>, 
<A HREF="VisualNumerics.math.DoubleLU.html">DoubleLU</A>, <A
 HREF="VisualNumerics.math.DoubleQR.html">DoubleQR</A> and <A
 HREF="VisualNumerics.math.DoubleSVD.html">DoubleSVD</A> encapsulate 
standard matrix decompositions. Their constructors take a matrix as an 
argument and compute the decomposition. This may throw an exception. 
Other member functions are then used to use or return parts of the 
decomposition. </P>
<P>
Analogous to these classes for double-precision arrays there will 
also be classes for Complex arrays.</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4">Special Functions</FONT> </P>
<P>
The <A HREF="VisualNumerics.math.Sfun.html">class Sfun</A> contains a 
collection of special functions. This class is analogous to the 
existing class java.lang.Math, but contains more advanced functions. 
This class is a collection of static member functions and data; it 
cannot be instantiated.</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4">Statistics</FONT> </P>
<P>
The <A HREF="VisualNumerics.math.Statistics.html">class Statistics</A>
 contains a collection of basic statistical functions. This class is a 
collection of static member functions; it cannot be instantiated. <BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="4">Mircrosoft Excel(tm) Statistics and Finance </FONT> </P>
<P>
There are a number of  <A HREF="fin.htm">statistical and financial functions</A>
available in Microsoft Excel(tm) that are not currently in the JNL 
specification.  VNI has implemented these functions in Java for the 
SmartTable product.
It has been sugggested that we should include them in the JNL as well.
