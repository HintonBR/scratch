In the source code there are comments to indicate where the code segments are that fulfilled the project.
I basically split it up into separate functions that took care of image rotation (the rotateImage method), interpolation
(the interpolate method), and the subtractImage method which performed the image subtraction.  
<br><strong>Image Subtraction</strong><br>
After going through pixel by pixel and subtracting the values to generate the output image I then created a histogram
of the new image and plotted it with Gnuplot.  By doing this I was able to establish threshold values at 140 and 200.  
Everything between that range I called on and using the summation of each "ON" pixel divided by the number of pixels that
were on I determined that the center of gravity was at the point 313, 268.
<br><strong>Image Translation and Rotation</strong><br>
I calculated the backwards warping algorithm for the transformation function to be<br> 
<code>y = (y<sup>'</sup> - yc)cosine(t) - (x<sup>'</sup> - xc)sine(t) + yc</code><br>
<code>x = (y<sup>'</sup> - yc)sine(t) + (x<sup>'</sup> - xc)cosine(t) + xc</code><br>    
I then used bilinear interpolation based on the equation given in the book to interpolate the output data points
from the input values calculated.  The difference between the two images that were rotated a total of 120 degrees
is obvious.  The reason why the one that was rotated in 15 degree increments to 120 degree stems from the loss
of data that occurs in the intervening transformations.  Each 15 degree rotation causes certain points to be mapped
outside the viewable size of the image (the image is finite) so we lose those data values.  When in subsequent rotations
those values would have been rotated back in they no longer exist in the output image and so black is mapped in and 
we get the rounded edges because it is those outer edges that are getting rotated out and then back in.  The 120 degree
rotation does the mapping immediately and so we don't get the intermediate data loss and thus then output image looks
complete and correct.
