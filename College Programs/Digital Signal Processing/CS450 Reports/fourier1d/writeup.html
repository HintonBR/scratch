<br><br><strong>Part A - Sin</strong><br>
Sin is an odd function so its imaginary part is nonzero while it's real part is 0 (any values are simply due to imprecision in floating point arithmetic).  The magnitude flips signs on the ends due to the squaring of 
the imaginary number to drag the -1 out from under the square root.     
<br><br><strong>Part A - Cosine</strong><br>
Cosine is an even function so its imaginary part is 0 and its real part is positive on both ends.  The image of the imaginary part shows data, but the scale of it is so
close to 0 that the points represent small floating point errors in the data and not real values in the imaginary portion of the signal.  
<br><br><strong>Part A - Cosine + Sin</strong><br>
The sum is simply the sum of the parts except for the magnitude which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the 
imaginary and real parts of the signal.  This is shown in the fact that the real part of the signal looks like the real part of the cosine because the
real part of the sine is 0 and the imaginary is just the opposite, it shows the imaginary part of the sin because the imag. part of a cosine is 
0.  The phases of the two signals add to simply the phase portion of the signal because of varying signs at different points.  
<br><br><strong>Prove Rect mathematically - Part B</strong><br>
<br><br><strong>Prove Gaussian mathmatically - Part C</strong><br>
<br><br><strong>Prove Convolution Theorem - Part D</strong><br>
The proof of the Convolution theorem is based on the result of applying the Convolution integral under the Fourier Transform
integral.  When taking the Fourier Transform of the convolution of two functions we can use the shift theorem to simplify the Fourier integral and as the derivation sequence on 
page 182 shows the integral simplified and then solved is the multiplication of the FT of one function with the FT of another function.
