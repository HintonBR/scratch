<br><br><strong>Part A</strong><br>
The magnitude shows for each image the spikes that occur at frequency 8 and -8 for cosine and sin from a top-down view.
The magnitude display of the frequency domain shows how much information can be encoded in a small amount of data.  We took the
vertical bands created by the functions and converted them into two single spikes without losing any data.     
<br><br><strong>Part B</strong><br>
We would expect to see the two images added together's magnitude to be the sum of their original Magnitudes because 
of the linearity of the Fourier Transfrom.  That is upheld by the two points being located at frequency 8, -8 on the x axis and 
frequency 4, -4 on the y-axis.  
<br><br><strong>Part C</strong><br>
The Fourier Transform has the property that maps rotations in the image in the spatial domain directly onto the frequency
domain.  Due to this property we would expect that the Magnitude of the Rotated Sum of the two images to be a rotated copy of the 
Magnitude of the sum and once again that is shown in the image (albeit faintly!) with the four points that were once located on the x and y axis rotated
by the same 15 degrees that the image was rotated by in the spatial domain.  
<br><br><strong>Part D</strong><br>
Multiplying the two images ends up having a masking effect and we see that the only places where there is white are where the two images
had overlapping white values.  Additionally this operation is exactly what we did in Problem 1 where we had to compute the Fourier Transform of
the sin(x) and sin(y).  The only difference there is the frequency of the points which would just adjust their location in the frequency domain.  As the book work indicated
we would expect four point again this time appearing in a box-like shape.   
<br><br><strong>Part E</strong><br>
From the examples in the book on page 202 the indication is that phase has a greater effect on the structure of the image and
thus output image 1 which had the magnitude of the ball and the phase of the gull we would expect to look more like the gull which it does.
This also holds true for image 2 which has the phase of the ball and shows an image of the ball.
