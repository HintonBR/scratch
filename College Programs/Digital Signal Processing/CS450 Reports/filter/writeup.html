<br><br><strong>Convolution using FFT and multiplication</strong><br>
The computational complexity of doing an two FFTs and then a multiply is O(N<sup>2</sup>log N) which compares to 2D Convolution's complexity of
O(N<sup>4</sup>).  The speedup it times is obvious.  The 0 seconds for every operation is a little misleading - time elapsed of course, but no single operation took a whole second to perform.
To perform all 6 operations the total elapsed time was somewhere around 3 seconds which compares to almost 3 minutes for the convolution operations.
The Sobel kernel operations show the lack of speedup that occurs when using a less than 7 X 7 kernel.  The operation on those kernels took essentially the same amount of time whether they were done
by Convolution or FFT.  With more accurate timing it may be that convolution would have actually done those faster. 
<br><strong>Image Filtering</strong><br>
To find the rogue frequency and filter it out my code scans through every point in frequency domain and takes it's magnitude and finds the difference
between it and the average of the magnitudes of its neighbors.  The points on the edges had to be handled differently because they possess fewer neighbors.
Also we only had to scan half the pixels actually because the negative frequencies are represented in the second half of the x values.  I computed the averages at both places and used that average
to replace the value at that point that was causing the interference in the image.
