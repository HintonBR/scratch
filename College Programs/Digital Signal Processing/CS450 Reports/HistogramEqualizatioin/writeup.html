The important part of the source code and the part that relates to histogram equalization falls in the 
createEqualizedImage method.  It is here that I use the JIGL libraries to generate a cumulative histogram.  
I then loop through every gray level and used the equation for histogram equalization by dividing the cumulative 
histogram count by the area of the original image and then multiplying that by 255 which was our maximum gray 
value and stored that value in the appropriate location of the lookup table.  After creating a deep copy of the 
original image and then looping each pixel and getting the gray value and using that to map into the lookup table 
to get the equalized gray value for that pixel.  The difference between the output and input image is obvious 
(and helped me to realize the value of histogram equalization).  By enhancing the image and scaling the image 
across the whole spectrum of gray values the image which had previous been lumped at the dark end of the gray 
spectrum and hidden was revealed!  The histogram and cumulative histogram of the original image show the lumping 
also in how they change rapidly for the dark gray levels and then level off as you get about a third of the way 
through the gray spectrum.  The resulting histogram is not completely level because of the high concentration at 
specific levels which also cause the gaps in the histogram because columns close to the large values have to be 
consolidated with other gray levels to produce the equalized image.
